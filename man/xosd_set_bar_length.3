.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
\fBxosd_set_bar_length\fR changes the percentage of the display used by a slider or percentage bar. Normally the XOSD choses a sensible length for the bar, but you may wish to change the default behavior if there are only a small number of possible values to be displayed.

.SH "ARGUMENTS"

.TP
\fIosd\fR
The XOSD window to alter.

.TP
\fIdisplayPercentage\fR
The percentage of the display to be used up by the slider or percentage bar, as an interger between 0 and 100. Setting \fIdisplayPercentage\fR to -1 reverts to the default behaviour.

.SH "RETURN VALUE"

.PP
On success, a zero is returned. On error, -1 is returned and \fIxosd_error\fR is set to indicate the reason for the error.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT"

.TP
\fIchar *xosd_error\fR
A string describing the error, if one occurred.
