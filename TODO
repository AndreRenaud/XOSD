Unordered TODOs
---------------
* Documentation on http://ldots.org/xosd-guide/
* More Xinerema configuration:
  - Use Xinerama at all ?
  - Which screen(s) to use ?
  - libxinerama or libxinerama_pic ?
* Find memory leak #191749.
  - xmms uses static variables in functions get_config_path(), which leaks.
  - Many X11 calls.
* Co-op with screensavers #145417.
* Write a note about broken woody version.
  - Broken locales.
  - Busy waiting.

* There's a bug in libtool that updates libtool when configure is run. This
  stuffs the Mandrake maintainer. Gotta update libtool when a new version
  is out.
  PMH: AM_MAINTAINER_MODE ?

* xosd window does not stay on top if the window manager is restarted

* report that xmms plugin displays volumne instead of title on song change.
  PMH: xmms_get_volume() returns -1 during song changes, which gets interpreted as a volume change.

* Fix outline which is no outline
  echo . | osd_cat -O 50 -p middle -A center
* Only update lines which were changed: Add a flag to each line
