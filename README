Please send any commentry to: xosd@ignavus.net

There are several modules here.

xosd.c & xosd.h combine to form (VOLTRON!) libxosd.so, which is the main
unit

xmms_osd.c becomes libxmms_osd.so which is an xmms plugin to display various
things whenever they change (volume, track, paused/shuffle/repeat etc...)

testprog.c is a simple test program, not supposed to do anything useful,
but handy if you're having problems getting it going.

osd_cat.c is another simple program, it simply reads from stdin and displays
it using osd. All its options are hardcoded, its not supposed to be used for
anything too smart, I am hoping someone will code a replacement for me :)

NB: The first thing to check is that you have a proper font #define'd, use
xfontsel to find a suitable one
