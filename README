BSD Notes:

I've heard that to compile xodf under BSD you have to include
getopt.c, getopt1.c, and getopt.h with the other files...BSD doesn't
have these in its default distro.



VERSION 2 notes:


I added and removed some of the header functions. In particular, xosd_init
is now deprecated (but still works) and has been replaced by xosd_create.
For naming consistency, I also did the same for xosd_uninit. It's
deprecated and replaced by xosd_destroy.

Other new features:
  xosd_set_offset
has been replaced by
  xosd_set_horizontal_offset
  xosd_set_vertical_offset

and we can now specify alignment to be top, middle, bottom and
left,center,right.



VERSION 1 notes:

There are several modules here.

xosd.c & xosd.h combine to form (VOLTRON!) libxosd.so, which is the main
unit

xmms_osd.c becomes libxmms_osd.so which is an xmms plugin to display various
things whenever they change (volume, track, paused/shuffle/repeat etc...)

testprog.c is a simple test program, not supposed to do anything useful,
but handy if you're having problems getting it going.

osd_cat.c is another simple program, it simply reads from stdin and displays
it using osd. All its options are hardcoded, its not supposed to be used for
anything too smart, I am hoping someone will code a replacement for me :)

NB: The first thing to check is that you have a proper font #define'd, use
xfontsel to find a suitable one

NBB: xosd is written in C99, which means you can't complain about my
use of C++ style comments.
