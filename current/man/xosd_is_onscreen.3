.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
\fBosd_is_onscreen\fR determines weather a XOSD window, is currently being shown (is mapped to the X display). Because XOSD displays data asynchronously (see \fBxosd_display\fR(3xosd) for details) it can be difficult to know if data is being displayed, \fBxosd_is_onscreen\fR solves this problem.

.PP
Call \fBxosd_show\fR(3xosd) or \fBxosd_hide\fR(3xosd) to alter the visibility of the XOSD window.

.SH "ARGUMENTS"

.TP
\fIosd\fR
The XOSD window to query.

.SH "RETURN VALUE"

.PP
A 1 is returned if the window is onscreen (mapped), or 0 if it is hidden (unmapped). On error, -1 is returned and \fIxosd_error\fR is set to indicate the reason for the error.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT"

.TP
\fIchar *xosd_error\fR
A string to a text string describing the error, if one occurred.

.SH "AUTHORS"
