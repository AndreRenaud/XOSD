Unordered TODOs
---------------
* Documentation on http://ldots.org/xosd-guide/
* More Xinerema configuration:
  - Use Xinerama at all ?
  - Which screen(s) to use ?
  - libxinerama or libxinerama_pic ?
* Find memory leak #191749.
  - xmms uses static variables in functions get_config_path(), which leaks.
  - Many X11 calls.
* Co-op with screensavers #145417.
* Write a note about broken woody version.
  - Broken locales.
  - Busy waiting.

* There's a bug in libtool that updates libtool when configure is run. This 
	stuffs the Mandrake maintainer. Gotta update libtool when a new version 
	is out.
