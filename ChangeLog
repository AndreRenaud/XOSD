2.3.0: 
        Applied 35 patches from the Debian maintainer. I thought that he
	was being quiet, but it turns out that my email had magically
	decided to stop forwarding and I wasn't getting any of his
	emails. <insert rant about university IT departments here>.

	Complete rewrite of libxosd to use only one thread calling X11.
	osd_cat --age parameter is now optional.

2.2.8:
	investigated using indent. From now on I'll use these arguments to
	  indent before releasing:
	    indent -br -ce -bap -bbo -npcs -nprs -nsob -nut xosd.c
	  (the program indent.sh should indent everything:) (Tim Wright)
	new version of osd_cat that can do percentage and slider bars (phil gees)
	speed optimisation (Piotr Chmura)

2.2.7:
	Complete rewrite of timeout_func to avoid sending
	  lineakd to 100% CPU. There was a case where timeout_func
	  would keep looping around in circles never pausing for breath.
	  (Tim Wright)

	  new xmms-osd plugin. We might remove this eventually. (Tim Wright)
