        Eungkyu Song's "xmms hanging in some non-C locale's patch" (Eungkyu Song)
	xmms plugin uses xosd default font (Tim Wright)

1.0.3:
	Man page affect/effect spelling patch (John McPherson)
	Many Autoconf and automake patches (Philipp Matthias Hahn)
	better default font for osd_cat and xosd (Tim Wright with hints from 
	  Philipp Matthias Hahn)
	xmms plugin segfault bugfix (Philipp Matthias Hahn)
	Fontset related memory leak (Philipp Matthias Hahn)
	KDE stay-on-top patch (Hans Verkuil) [he says it doesn't work,

       Autoconf fixes:
        Cleaned up autoconf scripts (patch from Philipp Matthias Hahn)
	Changed references to libxosd-config to xosd-config (Tim Wright)

	Put the xmms plugin and libxosd libraries in subdirectories of src/.
	  this was done to emable people to build libxosd without building the xmms
	  plugin. This might have broken the redhat packaging stuff.
	  (Tim Wright, based on patch by Mathieu Seigneurin)
